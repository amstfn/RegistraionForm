    <h1>Registration Form</h1>
    <p>Please fill out this form with the required information</p>
    <!-- The method attribute specifies how to send form-data to the URL specified in the action attribute.
    The form-data can be sent via a GET request as URL parameters (with method="get") or via a POST request as data in the request body (with method="post").
    Set the method attribute to send your form data via a POST request. -->
    <!-- Specifying the type attribute of a form element is important for the browser to know what kind of data it should expect.
    If the type is not specified, the browser will default to text.
    The email type only allows emails with a @ and a . in the domain. The password type obscures the input, and warns if the site does not use HTTPS. -->
    <!-- The first input element with a type of submit is automatically set to submit its nearest parent form element.
    To handle the form submission, after the last fieldset element add an input element with the type attribute set to submit and the value attribute set to Submit. -->
    <!-- Certain type attribute values come with built-in form validation. For example, type="email" requires that the value be a valid email address.
    Add custom validation to the password input element, by adding a minlength attribute with a value of 8. Doing so prevents inputs of less than 8 characters being submitted -->
    <!-- With type="password" you can use the pattern attribute to define a regular expression that the password must match to be considered valid.
    Add a pattern attribute to the password input element to require the input match: [a-z0-5]{8,}
    The above is a regular expression which matches eight or more lowercase letters or the digits 0 to 5. Then, remove the minlength attribute, and try it out. -->

        <!-- For the second fieldset, you want the input and label text to appear on the same line.
        Start, by giving the input elements in the second fieldset a class of inline. -->

            <!--  What if you wanted to allow a user to upload a profile picture?
            Well, the input type file allows just that 
            Add another label after the first, with the text Input your age (years): . Then, nest an input with the type of number.
            Next, add a min attribute to the input with a value of 13 because users under the age of 13 should not register.
            Also, users probably will not be over the age of 120; add a max attribute with a value of 120.-->
            <!-- Adding a dropdown to the form is easy with the select element.
            The select element is a container for a group of option elements, 
            and the option element acts as a label for each dropdown option.
            Both elements require closing tags. -->
            <!-- Submitting the form with an option selected would not send a useful value to the server.
            As such, each option needs to be given a value attribute. Without which, the text content of the option will be submitted to the server.
            Give the first option a value of "", and the subsequent option elements value attributes from 1 to 4. -->
            <!-- The textarea element acts like an input element of type text, but comes with the added benefit of being able to receive multi-line text,
            and an initial number of text rows and columns.
            Users will be able to register with a bio. Add a label with the text Provide a bio: at the end of the fieldset.
            Add  a textarea element inside the label element. Note that the textarea requires a closing tag. -->
            <!-- The textarea appears too small. To give it an initial size, you can add the rows and cols attributes.
            Add an initial size of 3 rows and 30 columns. -->
            <!-- To give Campers an idea of what to put in their bio, the placeholder attribute is used.
            The placeholder accepts a text value, which is displayed until the user starts typing.-->
            <!-- With form submissions, it is useful, and good practice, to provide each submittable element with a name attribute.
            This attribute is used to identify the element in the form submission.-->

<!-- as much as I know "id" use for these usages:
1- use in css to style particular element like this: #idName
2-use to link within a html like this:
<a href="#index-course">my course</a>
<div><p id="index-course" ></p></div>
3-use in javascript for managing elements
note:per page should use an id once not twice.I mean any element should have unique id.
